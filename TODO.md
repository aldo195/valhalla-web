# TODO

- Transition between basic and user layouts is buggy (both directions).

- Add a logout and redirect layer to api (should be triggered by and 403 response).

- Get rules from DB for analysis page (currently just mock data).

- Add DB implementation for notifications (currently just a stub).

- Implement forgot password mechanism ([like this](http://exploreflask.com/en/latest/users.html#forgot-your-password)).

- Implement user details page (change password, name, etc...).
